# Hello World in JAX-WS
This is a multiproject about [JAX-WS](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/bnayl.html).

## Hello World! Server (standalone)
[hellows-jar](hellows-jar) contains a demonstration of a web service build with [JAX-WS](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/bnayl.html) 
that can run standalone. That is, it does not require to be deployed in a server.

Run the code with ```gradle server``` and then navigate to [http://localhost:8080/helloWorld](http://localhost:8080/helloWorld) to 
retrieve a HTML page generated by JAX-WS that describes the service. 

Given that ```HelloWebService``` is a class annotated as ```@WebService``` with ```@WebMethod```s, the code required to run it 
in standalone mode is:
```java
public class Server {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Endpoint.publish("http://localhost:8080/helloWorld", new HelloWebService());
	}
}
```

# Hello World! Server (web application)
[hellows-war](hellows-war) contains a demonstration of a web service build with [JAX-WS](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/bnayl.html). 

Deploy your code to a [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) server with ```gradle jettyEclipseRun```. Then, open the page at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). 

The code is quite simple:
```java
@WebService
public class HelloWebService {
	
	@WebMethod()
	public String sayHello(String name) {
		return "Hello "+name +"!";
	}
}
```

The service endpoint is at [http://localhost:8080/helloWorld](http://localhost:8080/helloWorld) (see [WEB-INF/sun-jaxws.xml](src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/sun-jaxws.xml) for the endpoint mapping). 

Note that [WEB-INF/web.xml](src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml) has a ```<servlet-mapping>``` entry that matches ```/hello*``` to requests to the JAX-WS runtime.

# Hello World! Client
[hellows-cli-ws](hellows-cli-ws) contains a demonstration of a web client build with [JAX-WS](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/bnayl.html). 

This project requires a running ```hellows``` server (either ```gradle server``` or ```gradle jettyEclipseRun```). 

One of the first steps is the generation of the code required to invoke the client from
[HellowsCliService.wsdl](src/main/wsdl/HellowsCliService.wsdl) file. Look at [build.gradle](build.gradle) to get a glimpse of the 
complexities of the code generation process. If you want to create only the code just run ```gradle wsimport```.

The client can be run with the command ```gradle client```.
